BullsEye
BullsEye is a simple game developed in JavaScript using object-oriented programming. In this game, the player controls a character with the mouse and must save the eggs and larvae from monsters that appear on the right side of the screen and move towards the left side. The game uses basic physics and collision detection to allow objects to collide and push each other.
I made that according to the [FreeCodeCamp JS game crash course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U34l-Xz5ynU&t=193s).
But i refactored totally.

How to Play
The objective of the game is to prevent the monsters from reaching the left side of the screen and stealing the eggs and larvae. The player controls a character with the mouse, and can move the character by moving the mouse. The character can push the monsters to the right to prevent them from moving towards the left.

To win the game, the player must prevent all of the eggs and larvae from being stolen by the monsters. If a monster steals an egg or larvae, the player loses a life. The player starts the game with three lives, and loses a life each time a monster steals an egg or larvae.

The game is over when the player loses all three lives. The player can restart the game by refreshing the page.
